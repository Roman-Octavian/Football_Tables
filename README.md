This is a C# Console program that attempts to process CSV data in relation to Danish Football Leagues, made by someone with well-nigh zero knowledge about the sport; accuracy may vary.

Binaries can be found in the "bin" folder, the program itself contains instructions on how to use it, therefore, running it is the only requirement.

The data can be found in the "test" directory.
